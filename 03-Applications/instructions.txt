For each application involved in the automation, a copy of the folder "ApplicationGeneric" must be created and edited as follows:

1) Rename folder name according to the aplication name.
E.g.
For SAP Application, the folder must be renamed from "ApplicationGeneric" to "Sap"

2) Rename activities "InitializeAppGeneric" and "CloseOrKillAppGeneric" according to the aplication name.
E.g.
For SAP Application, the activities must be renamed to "InitializeSap" and "CloseOrKillSap", respectively.

3) Change ActivityBuilder name and Sequence name within each workflow to match their new names. 

4) Any other workflow that must be created to interact with an application should be placed in its folder.
